# Accordion-Componenet
This repository contains a simple accordion component built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The accordion displays three sections: "About Me," "Education &amp; Skills," and "Projects &amp; Achievements." When a section header is clicked, the corresponding content expands or collapses.
